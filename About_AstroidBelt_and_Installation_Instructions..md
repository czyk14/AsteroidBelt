# AsteroidBelt

About my Project and how to install:

Asteroid Belt is an endless runner video game made using Epic Game’s Unreal Engine (version 4.18.1) 
for mobile Android devices. The game utilizes the Android device’s gravity and gyroscope sensors 
to control a spaceship in an effort to navigate a procedurally generated asteroid belt for as long
as possible.

In order to control the ship, hold your phone screen as to make it perpendicular to the ground, and tilt it
towards and away from you to go up, and use the phone like a steering wheel to go left and right,

In order to install the application to your android device, follow the link below and click the download button.
After downloading, the app should install automatically. (please note that the device needs to allows application installations
from 3rd party sources, and also needs to have atleast .86Gb of free disk space)
